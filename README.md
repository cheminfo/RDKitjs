# Update 17/12/2019

This project is not currently active. We have switched to bundling a JS wrapper into the core 
RDKit suite (https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Code/MinimalLib) and currently plan to focus our efforts there.

More information is available in [this RDKit blog post](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2019/11/introducing-new-rdkit-javascript.html).
